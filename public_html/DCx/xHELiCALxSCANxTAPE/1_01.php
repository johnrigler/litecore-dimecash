This page lives in a directory structure which refers to an Dogecoin address.  The address and six transactions convey a meaning, which this page will thoroughly explain.  The address can be easily calculated to be: DCxxHELiCALxSCANxTAPEzzzzzzz9SCt4G

This unspendable address is on the Dogecoin network.  Various explorers can be queried to see its transactions, or the DogeCoin Core client can be used to obtain an extire copy of the blockchain so that the transactions could be queried privately.

The ledger currenty shows six transactions, in reverse order:

<pre>
"0.00018726"
"1.00012112"
"1.00021121"
"1.00011211"
"1.00012112"
"1.00021121"
</pre>

The total value of the account is only worth a few cents, which has essentially been destroyed.  The transactions show up in reverse order and present a pattern which, when considered in the context of the words "Helical Scan Tape" can be understood to show a the diagonal patten at the heart of the technology.  If you don't yet see the diagonal pattern, then look at this:

<pre>
"1.0001<span>2</span>11<span>2</span>"
"1.000<span>2</span>11<span>2</span>1"
"1.00011<span>2</span>11"
"1.0001<span>2</span>11<span>2</span>"
"1.000<span>2</span>11<span>2</span>1"
</pre>

The sixth transaction (shown first) is different, however.  The number 18726 is a reference to a function which both explains the tape technology and also parses out a JSON file <a href=chain.so> chain.so </a> which would be periodically created from the Dogecoin chain.

A bash function file <a href='helical.scan.tape-18726.2'> helical.scan.tape-18726.2 </a> is shown below.  Together, all of these elements imply a very strong meaning.  Much of the meaning can be inferred from the blockchain itself, but the script file would offer a complete explanation.  It would be very different to imagine a different sort of key that would better explain the number 18726, especially in the context of the words "Helical Scan Tape".  This is significant in that it begins to establish a way to communicate which is both public and private.
