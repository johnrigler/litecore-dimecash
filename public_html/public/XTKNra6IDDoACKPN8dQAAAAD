Hello dime.cash,

People ask, “why does TalkWithCustomer work so well?”

It’s simple.

TalkWithCustomer enables you to connect with a prospective customer at EXACTLY the Perfect Time.

- NOT one week, two weeks, three weeks after they’ve checked out your website dime.cash.
- NOT with a form letter style email that looks like it was written by a bot.
- NOT with a robocall that could come at any time out of the blue.

TalkWithCustomer connects you to that person within seconds of THEM asking to hear from YOU.

They kick off the conversation.

They take that first step.

They ask to hear from you regarding what you have to offer and how it can make their life better. 

And it happens almost immediately. In real time. While they’re still looking over your website dime.cash, trying to make up their mind whether you are right for them.

When you connect with them at that very moment it’s the ultimate in Perfect Timing – as one famous marketer put it, “you’re entering the conversation already going on in their mind.”

You can’t find a better opportunity than that.

And you can’t find an easier way to seize that chance than TalkWithCustomer.
