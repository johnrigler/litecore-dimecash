Welcome to Dimecash.  This site is currently undergoing massive construction.  If, however, you don't mind seeing the innards of a new system laid out before you, then head to the browser link to see how the Dimecash initiative is already at work prototyping services live on Dogecoin. If you have a dogecoin wallet, then you can be part of the fun.
