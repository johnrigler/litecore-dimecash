This site has an unspendable api that can be called via a http get:

<a href=
https://dime.cash/cgi-bin/unspendable.cgi?first=D&name=DCxFiRSTxUNiTED&seed=30 
> https://dime.cash/cgi-bin/unspendable.cgi?first=D&name=DCxFiRSTxUNiTED&seed=30</a>

or

> curl "https://dime.cash/cgi-bin/unspendable/cgi?first=D&name=DCxFiRSTxUNiTED&seed=30"
DCxDCxFiRSTxUNiTEDDxxxxxxxxxzCuKHf

The flags are:

first (D for Dogecoin)
name (Good luck, use little o, little i, capital L, and no 0) 
seed (30 for Dogecoin)

Right now, only dogecoin is supported, but you can download the python script and write your own wrapper or call it directly:

To learn more about the Base58Check format: 

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base58 </a>



Currently typechecking is not turned on, so if you enter an invalid character, this will throw up its hands.  You can't use "I", "l", "0", or "1" because they are too similar looking to each other.

If you succeed, you will redirected to a page like the one below.  Use your smart phone wallet app to capture an image of the QR code that you discover and then simply send some very small transaction.  Coming soon will be a form that creates the special bash functions that I use, will tell you what hash to send, and will keep a copy of your secret.
